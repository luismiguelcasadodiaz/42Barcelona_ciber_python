Objective
The goal of the exercise is to get you used with built-in methods, more 
particularly with those allowing to perform operations. Student is expected
to code built-in methods for vector-vector and vector-scalar operations as 
rigorously as possible.


Instructions
In this exercise, you have to create a Vector class. The goal is to create 
vectors and be able to perform mathematical operations with them.
• Column vectors are represented as list of lists of single float ([[1.], [2.], [3.]]), 
• Row vectors are represented as a list of a list of several floats ([[1., 2., 3.]]).
