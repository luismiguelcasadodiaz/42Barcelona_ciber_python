"""
Objective:

The goal of the exercise is to discover 2 useful methods for lists, tuples,
dictionnaries (iterable class objects more generally) named zip and enumerate.

Instructions
Code a class Evaluator, that has two static functions named zip_evaluate
and enumerate_evaluate.

The goal of these 2 functions is to compute the sum of:
  -- the words of every words of a given list
  -- weighted by a list of coefficinents coefs

  (yes, the 2 functions should do the same thing).


The lists coefs and words have to be the same length.
If this is not the case, the function should return -1.


You have to obtain the desired result using zip in the zip_evaluate function,
and with enumerate in the enumerate_evaluate function
