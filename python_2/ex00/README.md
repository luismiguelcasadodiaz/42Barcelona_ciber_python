Objective

The goal of the exercise is to work on the built-in functions map, filter and 
reduce.

Instructions

Implement the functions ft_map, ft_filter and ft_reduce. 

Take the time to under stand the use cases of these two built-in functions 
(map and filter) and the function reduce in functools module. 

You are not expected to code specific classes to create ft_map, ft_filter or
ft_reduce objects.

DO NOT USE Built-in funtions map, reduce or filter from itertools
